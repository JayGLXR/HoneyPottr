## 🎯 **What is HoneyPottr?**

HoneyPottr is a cybersecurity deception tool that creates honeypot artifacts on Windows systems to trick malware into believing it's running in a sandbox or analysis environment. When sophisticated malware performs environment checks to avoid detection, it encounters these artifacts and self-terminates, protecting your system from infection.

### **The Problem**
Modern malware often includes sandbox detection mechanisms to avoid analysis by security researchers. These "evasive" malware samples check for:
- Virtual machine indicators (VMware, VirtualBox)
- Analysis tools (Wireshark, Process Monitor)
- Honeypot environments
- Debugging tools

When detected, the malware simply exits without deploying its payload, making it harder to analyze but also harder to infect real systems.

### **The Solution**
HoneyPottr flips this defensive mechanism into a protective feature by making your real system *appear* to be a honeypot or analysis environment. The malware performs its checks, finds the fake artifacts, and deletes itself - protecting your system without any user intervention.

## 🛡️ **How It Works**

HoneyPottr operates as an invisible Windows service that continuously maintains realistic honeypot artifacts:

### **Registry Artifacts**
- VMware Tools installation entries
- VirtualBox Guest Additions registry keys  
- Sandboxie configuration entries
- Analysis tool installation records

### **File System Artifacts**
- Fake VMware and VirtualBox executables
- Dummy analysis tool binaries
- Simulated driver files
- Honeypot-specific directories

### **Process & Service Artifacts**
- Virtual machine service entries
- Simulated analysis tool processes
- Fake system services

### **Hardware Artifacts**
- Virtual machine BIOS signatures
- Fake hardware device entries
- VM-specific system information

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- **🔍 Invisible Operation**: Runs completely in the background with no visible interface
- **⚡ Lightweight**: < 50MB RAM usage, < 1% CPU utilization
- **🔄 Automatic**: Set-and-forget operation with automatic startup
- **🛠️ Configurable**: Multiple artifact profiles (Basic, Advanced, Custom)
- **🏢 Enterprise Ready**: Professional installer with Terms of Service
- **🔒 Secure**: Runs with minimal privileges, digitally signed
- **📊 Monitoring**: Built-in performance monitoring and resource limits

## 📥 **Installation**

### **Quick Install (Recommended)**
